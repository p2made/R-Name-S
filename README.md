# R-Name S

![R-Name S](./Documentation/images/icon_256x256.png)


Once upon a time there was a really neat file renaming utility called R-Name. Then Apple dropped support for PPC emulation in OS X, but the original developer wasn't maintaining R-Name anymore. Someone had picked up the source code so they released it as a Universal Binary (R-Name UB).

Now I can't even find a recent R-Name online, but I have the source code of the version I currently use. This project is to recreate R-Name in pure [Swift](https://swift.org) code.

### Steps

1. Clone R-Name as a Swift application leaving the whole application design alone.
2. Revise & update the UI.
3. Look at possible new features.

### UNICEF / MSF

In keeping with the spirit of Yoichi Tagaya's work, R-Name S will be donationware. However I have decided to make [MSF](http://www.msf.org/) the benificiary of R-Name S.

### New Feature Ideas

- Operation history.
- Saved operations.
- Name conflict resolution.
